# DES Encryption Algorithm Implementation
--------

This repository contains a Java implementation of the DES (Data Encryption Standard) encryption algorithm.

## Overview
--------

The DES algorithm is a legacy cryptography algorithm technique that was used to encrypt and decrypt 64-bit texts using 64-bit keys, it runs for 16 rounds making it more difficult to crack than other old techniques.

## Features
--------

* Implementation of the DES encryption algorithm in Java
* Supports encryption and decryption of binary and text data
* Includes a `DES` class for encrypting and decrypting 
* Includes a `DES_Utility` class for various utilities used within the project
* Includes a `Key` class for generating and managing DES keys
* Includes a `Des_Tables` class for confusion and diffusion operations
## Usage
-----

To use this implementation, simply clone the repository and import it into your Java project. You can then use the `DES` class to encrypt and decrypt data. No external libraries are required.
